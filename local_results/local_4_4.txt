		Available nearby nodes (no report received in last 20 iterations): 3,
		Communication time between nodes: 5.17661ms
		Communication time between reporting node and base station: 25.86448ms
		Time between report received and report processed: 42.07252ms
		Total messages sent between reporting node and base station: 1
		Action taken by base station following report: Did not reply to reporting node (its neighbour(s) had sufficient availability).

Summary:
	Total messages received: 84
	Total messages processed: 84
	Total report messages: 55
	Total alert messages: 29
	Total outgoing messages: 29
	Total communication time between nodes: 866.05949ms
	Average communication time between nodes: 10.31023ms
	Total communication time between nodes and base station: 12992.25941ms
	Average communication time between nodes and base station: 154.66975ms
	Total latency between message received and message processed by base station: 23216.18371ms
	Average latency between message received and message processed by base station: 276.38314
Checks:
	total messages received = total messages processed = total report messages + total alert messages
	total alert messages = total outgoing messages
